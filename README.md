# Safebox API Challenge

This coding challenge was provided by [Rviewer](https://web.archive.org/web/20240425100142/https://rviewer.io/) but now that platform is shut down.

Check the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md) for context about the challenge.

Here you'll find two different implementations:

1. The original implementation following DDD and Hexagonal Architecture, present in the [ddd-hexagonal](https://github.com/backpackerhh/challenge-be-safebox-api-rails/tree/ddd-hexagonal) branch.
2. An implementation following the classical Rails-way, migrated from the DDD implementation, present in the [rails-way](https://github.com/backpackerhh/challenge-be-safebox-api-rails/tree/rails-way) branch.

You'll find details about each implementation in the corresponding branch.
